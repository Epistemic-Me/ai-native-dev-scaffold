## Philosophy

### Paper Trails Over Comments

Instead of inline comments that rot, we maintain living documentation:

- **RESEARCH.md** - Why are we doing this? What options did we consider?
- **PLAN.md** - How will we implement it? What's in/out of scope?
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - What did we actually build? What did we learn?

### Decisions Are First-Class

Every significant technical decision gets an ADR that captures context at decision time, documents alternatives considered, explains trade-offs, and is linkable from code and PRs.

### AI as Collaborator

The `.claude/commands/` folder contains slash commands that automate documentation scaffolding, enforce consistent structure, and reduce friction in the development process.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this scaffold

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-native-dev-scaffold.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git
git init
```

### 2. Install Claude commands

**Option A: Global install** (available in all projects):

```bash
cp -r .claude/commands/project ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r .claude/commands/hl ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r .claude/commands/shared ~/.claude/commands/
```

**Option B: Project-local** (leave them in `.claude/commands/`).

### 3. Try it out

```bash
# Start your first PR
/project:start-pr 001 initial-setup

# Or jump straight into the full lifecycle
/project:execute-pr 001
```

## Walkthrough: Feature to Production

Here's a concrete example of taking a feature from idea to merged code using the scaffold. We'll add user authentication to a project.

### Step 1: Start the PR

```
/project:start-pr 042 user-authentication
```

This creates:
- Branch: `feature/pr-042-user-authentication`
- Paper trail: `docs/prs/2025-02-07-PR-042-user-authentication/`
  - `RESEARCH.md` (empty template)
  - `PLAN.md` (empty template)
  - `IMPLEMENTATION.md` (empty template)
- Updates `ACTIVE_PRS.md`
- Commits the paper trail to the feature branch

### Step 2: Research the problem

Fill in RESEARCH.md yourself, or use Claude to help research the codebase:

```
/hl:research_codebase_nt
> How does our app currently handle sessions? What auth patterns exist?
```

Then fill in RESEARCH.md with the problem statement, options you considered (JWT vs sessions vs OAuth), and your recommendation. This is the "why" behind the work.

If you're making a significant architectural choice, record it:

```
/project:decision jwt-authentication
```

### Step 3: Plan the implementation

Write PLAN.md with the chosen approach, scope, technical design, and implementation order. Or use Claude to generate a plan:

```
/hl:create_plan
> Implement JWT authentication based on docs/prs/2025-02-07-PR-042-user-authentication/RESEARCH.md
```

This researches the codebase, presents design options, and writes a phased plan with success criteria to PLAN.md.

Need to revise the plan after feedback?

```
/hl:iterate_plan docs/prs/2025-02-07-PR-042-user-authentication/PLAN.md
> Add rate limiting to the login endpoint and split into smaller phases
```

### Step 4: Implement

```
/project:implement-pr 042
```

This reads PLAN.md, creates a TodoWrite task list from the implementation order, and works through each task. As it goes, it:
- Tracks progress (`3/7 tasks complete`)
- Makes incremental commits on the feature branch
- Updates IMPLEMENTATION.md with key changes and any deviations from the plan
- Pauses on blockers to ask you how to proceed

### Step 5: Verify

```
/project:verify-pr 042
```

Auto-detects your project's verification tools and runs them:

```
PR-042 Verification Results

| Check     | Status | Notes     |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Lint      | PASS   |           |
| TypeCheck | PASS   |           |
| Tests     | PASS   | 87% cov   |
| Build     | PASS   |           |

Overall: PASS
```

If anything fails, fix it and re-run. Verification must pass before moving on.

### Step 6: Push and create the GitHub PR

```
/hl:commit
```

Stages and commits with a conventional commit message. Then push:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/pr-042-user-authentication
```

Create the GitHub PR:

```
/hl:describe_pr 042
```

This generates a PR description from your paper trail (RESEARCH.md + PLAN.md + IMPLEMENTATION.md), analyzes the diff, and creates/updates the PR on GitHub.

### Step 7: Review

Have a teammate review, or review locally:

```
/hl:local_review 042
```

This analyzes the diff, CI status, and presents a structured review with findings. Can post the review to GitHub.

### Step 8: Merge and close

After approval:

```
/project:close-pr 042
```

This:
- Merges the PR via `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
- Checks out main and pulls
- Completes IMPLEMENTATION.md (summary, learnings)
- Moves the PR from "Open" to "Recently Merged" in ACTIVE_PRS.md
- Checks for architectural decisions and prompts ADR creation if needed
- Commits documentation updates to main

### Step 9: Update project context

```
/project:context-update
```

Refreshes all `.context/` files to reflect the new state of the project.

### The Automated Path

Don't want to run each step manually? The master orchestrator does everything:

```
/project:execute-pr 042
```

This chains together all 8 phases automatically:

```
start-pr → implement-pr → verify-pr → push → create GH PR → approval gate → close-pr → context-update
```

It pauses at the approval gate to let you review before merging. If interrupted at any point, re-running the same command detects existing state and resumes where it left off.

### For Small Tasks

If the full paper trail feels like overkill:

```
/hl:oneshot_plan
> Add a logout button to the nav bar
```

This does research, planning, and implementation in one session. Still creates a feature branch and PR, just without the full `docs/prs/` paper trail.

Or for rapid prototyping:

```
/hl:founder_mode
```

Bias toward action over planning. Makes assumptions instead of asking questions. Still enforces branch safety and PRs.

## PR Paper Trail Format

Each PR gets a folder (`docs/prs/{date}-PR-{num}-{slug}/`) with three documents:

**RESEARCH.md** - The "why": Problem statement, context gathered, options considered with pros/cons, recommendation, open questions.

**PLAN.md** - The "how": Chosen approach, scope (in/out), technical design, implementation order, testing strategy, definition of done.

**IMPLEMENTATION.md** - The "what": Summary of what was built, key changes, deviations from plan, learnings, follow-up items.

## ADR Format

Architecture Decision Records live in `docs/decisions/` and follow this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
**PR**: #number (if applicable)

## Context
What issue motivates this decision?

## Decision
What are we doing?

## Consequences
### Positive
### Negative

## Alternatives Considered
What else did we evaluate? Why not chosen?

## Related
Links to PRs, other ADRs, external resources
```

## Best Practices

- **Always work on feature branches** - Never commit to master/main
- **Fill in RESEARCH.md before coding** - Understand the problem first
- **Update PLAN.md when scope changes** - Keep it current, not aspirational
- **Complete IMPLEMENTATION.md with learnings** - Future you will thank you
- **Record significant decisions as ADRs** - Especially ones future developers will question
- **Run `/project:context-update` regularly** - Keep living docs current
- **Use `/project:context-status` to check health** - Catch staleness early
