# Claude Code Project Context

This file provides guidance to Claude Code instances when working with projects using this scaffold.

## MANDATORY: PR Workflow Rules

**NEVER commit directly to master/main.** All code changes MUST follow PR workflow.

### Before ANY Code Changes
1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If on master/main → **STOP** and create feature branch
3. Check for PR: `gh pr view`
4. If no PR → suggest creating draft PR

### Blocked Operations on master/main
- `git commit` (any form)
- `git push origin master/main`
- File edits via Edit/Write tools without branch check

See `.claude/commands/shared/branch-safety.md` for enforcement details.

## Workflow: Feature to Production

### The Automated Path

For any feature, the master orchestrator handles everything:

```
/project:execute-pr {num}
```

This runs the full lifecycle automatically:

```
start-pr → implement-pr → verify-pr → push → create GH PR → approval gate → close-pr → context-update
```

It pauses at the approval gate for human review before merging. If interrupted, re-running detects existing state and resumes.

### The Manual Path (Step by Step)

**1. Start the PR** — creates feature branch and paper trail:
```
/project:start-pr {num} {slug}
```
Creates `feature/pr-{num}-{slug}` branch and `docs/prs/{date}-PR-{num}-{slug}/` with RESEARCH.md, PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md.

**2. Research** — understand the problem before coding:
- Fill in RESEARCH.md with problem statement, options considered, recommendation
- Use `/hl:research_codebase_nt` to explore the codebase
- Record architectural decisions with `/project:decision {slug}`

**3. Plan** — define the implementation approach:
- Fill in PLAN.md with scope, technical design, implementation order
- Or generate one: `/hl:create_plan`
- Revise after feedback: `/hl:iterate_plan {path-to-plan} {feedback}`

**4. Implement** — execute the plan with progress tracking:
```
/project:implement-pr {num}
```
Reads PLAN.md, creates TodoWrite tasks, implements phase by phase, updates IMPLEMENTATION.md.

**5. Verify** — run all available checks:
```
/project:verify-pr {num}
```
Auto-detects lint, typecheck, test, build and reports pass/fail. Must pass before merge.

**6. Commit and push**:
```
/hl:commit
git push -u origin feature/pr-{num}-{slug}
```

**7. Create/update GitHub PR**:
```
/hl:describe_pr {num}
```
Generates PR description from paper trail, analyzes diff, creates/updates PR on GitHub.

**8. Review** — get human approval:
- Have teammate review, or use `/hl:local_review {num}` for local analysis
- Never merge without human approval

**9. Merge and close**:
```
/project:close-pr {num}
```
Merges via `gh pr merge --squash`, completes IMPLEMENTATION.md, updates ACTIVE_PRS.md, checks for ADRs, commits docs.

**10. Update context**:
```
/project:context-update
```
Refreshes all `.context/` files. Check health anytime with `/project:context-status`.

### For Smaller Tasks

| Situation | Use this |
|-----------|----------|
| Medium task (hours) | `/hl:oneshot_plan` — research, plan, implement in one session |
| Quick fix | `/hl:founder_mode` — bias toward action, still uses PRs |
| Need plan only | `/hl:create_plan` then `/project:implement-pr` |
| Continuing work | `/hl:resume_handoff` |
| Debugging | `/hl:debug` |

## Documentation Patterns

### PR Paper Trail

Each PR gets `docs/prs/{date}-PR-{num}-{slug}/` with:
- **RESEARCH.md** — The "why": problem statement, options, recommendation
- **PLAN.md** — The "how": scope, design, implementation order, definition of done
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** — The "what": changes made, deviations, learnings

### Architecture Decision Records

Record significant decisions with `/project:decision {slug}`. Use ADRs when:
- Choosing between competing technologies
- Establishing patterns for the codebase
- Making trade-offs that affect the system
- Decisions that future developers will question

### Best Practices

- **Fill RESEARCH.md before coding** — understand the problem first
- **Update PLAN.md when scope changes** — keep it current, not aspirational
- **Complete IMPLEMENTATION.md with learnings** — future you will thank you
- **Run `/project:context-update` regularly** — keep living docs current
- **Use `/project:context-status` to check health** — catch staleness early
- **One decision per ADR** — supersede rather than delete old decisions
