# Create Implementation Plan

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans through an interactive, iterative process. You should be skeptical, thorough, and work collaboratively with the user to produce high-quality technical specifications.

## Initial Response

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check if parameters were provided**:
   - If a file path or ticket reference was provided as a parameter, skip the default message
   - Immediately read any provided files FULLY
   - Begin the research process

2. **If no parameters provided**, respond with:
```
I'll help you create a detailed implementation plan. Let me start by understanding what we're building.

Please provide:
1. The task/ticket description (or reference to a file)
2. Any relevant context, constraints, or specific requirements
3. Links to related research or previous implementations

I'll analyze this information and work with you to create a comprehensive plan.
```

Then wait for the user's input.

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Context Gathering & Initial Analysis

1. **Read all mentioned files immediately and FULLY**:
   - Ticket/task files
   - Research documents
   - Related implementation plans
   - Any JSON/data files mentioned
   - **IMPORTANT**: Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters to read entire files
   - **NEVER** read files partially - if a file is mentioned, read it completely

2. **Spawn initial research tasks to gather context**:
   Before asking the user any questions, use the Task tool to research in parallel:
   - Find all files related to the task
   - Understand how the current implementation works
   - Find any existing documentation about this feature

3. **Read all files identified by research tasks**:
   - After research tasks complete, read ALL files they identified as relevant
   - Read them FULLY into the main context
   - This ensures you have complete understanding before proceeding

4. **Analyze and verify understanding**:
   - Cross-reference the requirements with actual code
   - Identify any discrepancies or misunderstandings
   - Note assumptions that need verification

5. **Present informed understanding and focused questions**:
   ```
   Based on the task and my research of the codebase, I understand we need to [accurate summary].

   I've found that:
   - [Current implementation detail with file:line reference]
   - [Relevant pattern or constraint discovered]
   - [Potential complexity or edge case identified]

   Questions that my research couldn't answer:
   - [Specific technical question that requires human judgment]
   - [Business logic clarification]
   - [Design preference that affects implementation]
   ```

   Only ask questions that you genuinely cannot answer through code investigation.

### Step 2: Research & Discovery

After getting initial clarifications:

1. **If the user corrects any misunderstanding**:
   - DO NOT just accept the correction
   - Spawn new research tasks to verify the correct information
   - Read the specific files/directories they mention
   - Only proceed once you've verified the facts yourself

2. **Create a research todo list** using TodoWrite to track exploration tasks

3. **Spawn parallel sub-tasks for comprehensive research**:
   - Use the Task tool to research different aspects concurrently
   - Find relevant source files, configs, and tests
   - Identify conventions and patterns to follow
   - Look for integration points and dependencies

4. **Wait for ALL sub-tasks to complete** before proceeding

5. **Present findings and design options**:
   ```
   Based on my research, here's what I found:

   **Current State:**
   - [Key discovery about existing code]
   - [Pattern or convention to follow]

   **Design Options:**
   1. [Option A] - [pros/cons]
   2. [Option B] - [pros/cons]

   **Open Questions:**
   - [Technical uncertainty]
   - [Design decision needed]

   Which approach aligns best with your vision?
   ```

### Step 3: Plan Structure Development

Once aligned on approach:

1. **Create initial plan outline**:
   ```
   Here's my proposed plan structure:

   ## Overview
   [1-2 sentence summary]

   ## Implementation Phases:
   1. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   2. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]
   3. [Phase name] - [what it accomplishes]

   Does this phasing make sense? Should I adjust the order or granularity?
   ```

2. **Get feedback on structure** before writing details

### Step 4: Detailed Plan Writing

After structure approval:

1. **Write the plan** to `docs/prs/{date}-PR-{num}-{slug}/PLAN.md` or a dedicated plans directory

2. **Use this template structure**:

```markdown
# [Feature/Task Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[Brief description of what we're implementing and why]

## Current State Analysis

[What exists now, what's missing, key constraints discovered]

## Desired End State

[A specification of the desired end state after this plan is complete, and how to verify it]

### Key Discoveries:
- [Important finding with file:line reference]
- [Pattern to follow]
- [Constraint to work within]

## What We're NOT Doing

[Explicitly list out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep]

## Implementation Approach

[High-level strategy and reasoning]

## Phase 1: [Descriptive Name]

### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required:

#### 1. [Component/File Group]
**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary of changes]

### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Feature works as expected when tested via UI
- [ ] No regressions in related features

## Phase 2: [Descriptive Name]

[Similar structure...]

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- [What to test]
- [Key edge cases]

### Integration Tests:
- [End-to-end scenarios]

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. [Specific step to verify feature]
2. [Another verification step]

## References

- Original task: [link or description]
- Related research: [links]
- Similar implementation: [file:line]
```

### Step 5: Review and Iterate

1. **Present the draft plan location**:
   ```
   I've created the initial implementation plan at:
   `docs/prs/{path}/PLAN.md`

   Please review it and let me know:
   - Are the phases properly scoped?
   - Are the success criteria specific enough?
   - Any technical details that need adjustment?
   - Missing edge cases or considerations?
   ```

2. **Iterate based on feedback** - be ready to:
   - Add missing phases
   - Adjust technical approach
   - Clarify success criteria
   - Add/remove scope items

3. **Continue refining** until the user is satisfied

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical**:
   - Question vague requirements
   - Identify potential issues early
   - Ask "why" and "what about"
   - Don't assume - verify with code

2. **Be Interactive**:
   - Don't write the full plan in one shot
   - Get buy-in at each major step
   - Allow course corrections
   - Work collaboratively

3. **Be Thorough**:
   - Read all context files COMPLETELY before planning
   - Research actual code patterns using parallel sub-tasks
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers
   - Write measurable success criteria

4. **Be Practical**:
   - Focus on incremental, testable changes
   - Consider migration and rollback
   - Think about edge cases
   - Include "what we're NOT doing"

5. **Track Progress**:
   - Use TodoWrite to track planning tasks
   - Update todos as you complete research
   - Mark planning tasks complete when done

6. **No Open Questions in Final Plan**:
   - If you encounter open questions during planning, STOP
   - Research or ask for clarification immediately
   - Do NOT write the plan with unresolved questions
